# Complexity Analysis
# Let n be the number of elements in the nums array.

# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# State Space: The problem is broken down into subproblems defined by the state (i, prev_i).
# The index i (current element) can range from 0 to n.
# The index prev_i (previous element) can range from -1 to n-1.
# This gives a total of n * (n + 1) or roughly n^2 unique states.
# Work per State: Thanks to memoization, the body of the solve function is executed only once for each unique state (i, prev_i). The work inside the function (comparisons, max function, dictionary access) is constant time, O(1).
# Total Time: The total time complexity is the number of unique states multiplied by the work per state. Total Time = (Number of States) Ã— (Work per State) = O(n^2) * O(1) = O(n^2).
# Space Complexity: O(n^2)
# The space complexity is determined by the size of the memoization table and the depth of the recursion stack.

# Memoization Table (memo):
# The memo dictionary stores the result for every unique state (i, prev_i).
# In the worst case, the algorithm will compute and store the result for all O(n^2) states.
# Therefore, the space required for the memo dictionary is O(n^2).
# Recursion Stack:
# The depth of the recursion is determined by the longest path of recursive calls. In each step, i is incremented by 1.
# The maximum depth of the recursion stack will be n.
# This contributes O(n) to the space complexity.
# The space for the memoization table (O(n^2)) dominates the space for the recursion stack (O(n)).

# Therefore, the total space complexity is O(n^2).
