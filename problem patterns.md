# Two pointers
Used when going through a linnear structure(arr or linked list or strings).

Instead of brute force approach where you search the whole array for every element, two pointers approach improves it and reduces time complexity from n^2 to n.

Use case:
Pointers move in same dicrection. One is faster than the other one. Exampe: find middle of linked list.
Opposite direction. Example: find duplicates.


# Dynamic problem
Breaking down a complex problem into set of simpler underlying propblems AND reusing result of those undelying problems to solve the original problem.
## Approaches
Top-down: TODO.
Bbottom-up: More efficient: Example: CoinChange, Break strings in words from dict.
