# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity: O(m √ó n √ó 4^L)
# Where:

# m = number of rows
# n = number of columns
# L = length of the word
# Breakdown:
# Outer loops: O(m √ó n) - try starting from each cell
# DFS from each starting cell: O(4^L) in worst case
# Total: O(m √ó n √ó 4^L)
# Why 4^L?
# At each step of the DFS:

# We have 4 directions to explore (up, down, left, right)
# We do this for L steps (length of word)
# Worst case: 4 √ó 4 √ó 4 √ó ... (L times) = 4^L
# However, the visited array provides pruning, so in practice it's much better than 4^L.

# üíæ Space Complexity: O(L)
# Space Usage:
# Visited array: O(m √ó n) - but this is input modification, not extra space
# Recursion stack: O(L) - maximum depth is word length
# Total: O(L) if we modify input, O(m √ó n + L) if we use separate visited array
# üéØ Practical Analysis
# Best Case: O(m √ó n)
# Word found immediately at first position
# No backtracking needed
# Average Case: Much better than O(m √ó n √ó 4^L)
# Visited array prevents revisiting cells
# Most paths terminate early due to character mismatches
# Effective branching factor << 4
# Worst Case: O(m √ó n √ó 4^L)
# Word uses all unique characters
# Many valid partial paths exist
# Example: Finding "ABCDEFGH" in a grid full of these letters
