Oh-no! You forgot the number combination that unlocks your safe. Luckily, you knew that you'd be forgetful so you previously wrote down a bunch of hints that can be used to determine the correct combination. Each hint is a pair of numbers 'x, y' that indicates you must enter digit 'x' before 'y' (but not necessarily immediately before y).

The keypad on the safe has digits 0-9. You can assume that the hints will generate exactly one working combination and that a digit can occur zero or one time in the answer.

Write a function, safe_cracking, that takes in a list of hints as an argument and determines the combination that will unlock the safe. The function should return a string representing the combination.

safe_cracking([
  (7, 1),
  (1, 8),
  (7, 8),
]) # -> '718'
