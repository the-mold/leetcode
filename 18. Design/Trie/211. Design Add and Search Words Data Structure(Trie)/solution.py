# Complexity

# addWord:
# Time complexity: O(M), where M is the key length. At each step, we either examine or create a node in the trie. That takes only M operations.
# Space complexity: O(M). In the worst-case newly inserted key doesn't share a prefix with the keys already inserted in the trie. We have to add M new nodes, which takes O(M) space.

# search:
# Time complexity: O(M) for the "well-defined" words without dots, where M is the key length, and N is a number of keys, and O(Nâ‹…26**M) for the "undefined" words. That corresponds to the worst-case situation of searching an undefined word  
# M times which is one character longer than all inserted keys.
# Space complexity: O(1) for the search of "well-defined" words without dots, and up to O(M) for the "undefined" words, to keep the recursion stack.
