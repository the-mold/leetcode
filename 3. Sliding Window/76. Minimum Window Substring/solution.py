        Finds the minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t.

        This solution uses the sliding window algorithm with basic dictionaries.

        1.  It first creates a frequency map of characters in `t` using a standard dict.
        2.  It then uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define a sliding window in `s`.
        3.  The `right` pointer expands the window. As it does, we track the characters
            from `t` that are now satisfied within our window.
        4.  Once the window contains all required characters from `t`, we try to shrink
            it from the left by moving the `left` pointer. This helps us find the
            smallest possible valid window.
        5.  We keep track of the minimum window found so far and return it after
            checking all possibilities.

# Time Complexity: O(M + N)
# Building the Frequency Map (O(N)): First, we iterate through the string t once to create the dict_t frequency map. This takes time proportional to the length of t, so it's O(N).
# Sliding Window (O(M)): The core of the algorithm uses two pointers, left and right.
# The right pointer moves from the start to the end of string s exactly once.
# The left pointer also moves from the start to the end of s at most once.
# Even though there's a nested while loop, each character of s is processed by the right pointer once and by the left pointer once. This means we are effectively making a single pass over s. Therefore, this part of the algorithm is O(M).
# Combining these two steps, the total time complexity is O(N) + O(M) = O(M + N). This is very efficient because the runtime scales linearly with the size of the input strings.
