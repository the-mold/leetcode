# Time Complexity: O(N * M^N)
# The algorithm builds a recursion tree. The depth of this tree is N.
# At each level of the tree, we branch out for each possible letter of the current digit. In the worst case, we create M branches.
# This results in a total of M^N possible combinations (the leaf nodes of the tree).
# For each of these M^N combinations, we perform an operation to create the final string. In Python, creating the final string current_combination of length N takes O(N) time.
# Therefore, the total time complexity is the number of solutions multiplied by the time it takes to build each solution, which is O(N * M^N).

# Space Complexity: O(N) (excluding output) or O(N * M^N) (including output)
# The space complexity can be viewed in two ways:
# Excluding the output array: The main space usage comes from the recursion call stack. The maximum depth of the recursion is N (the length of the input digits). Therefore, the space complexity for the call stack is O(N).
# Including the output array: The result list stores all the generated combinations. As we established, there are M^N combinations, and each combination has a length of N. So, the space required to store the final result is O(N * M^N).
