Given two single-digit integers x and y, and a positive integer n,
find the largest number that can be formed using only digits x and y,
such that the sum of its digits equals n.

    For example:
    x=3, y=4, n=13 -> "4333"
    x=8, y=1, n=20 -> "8811111111111"
    x=6, y=9, n=10 -> "No solution"

Constraints:
x != y
0<= x,y <= 9
