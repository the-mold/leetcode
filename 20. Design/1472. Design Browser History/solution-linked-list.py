# Time complexity:

# In the visit(url) method, we insert a new node in our doubly linked list, it will take O(l) time to create a new node (to allocate memory for l characters of the url string), and then we mark this new node as current which will take O(1) time.
# Thus, in the worst case each call to the visit(url) method will take O(l) time.

# In the back(steps) and forward(steps) methods, we iterate on our doubly linked list nodes and stop when m nodes are iterated or we reached the end.
# Thus, in the worst case, each call to these methods will take O(min(m,n)) time.

# Space complexity:

# We might visit n URL strings and they will be stored in our doubly linked list.
# Thus, in the worse case, we use O(lâ‹…n) space.
