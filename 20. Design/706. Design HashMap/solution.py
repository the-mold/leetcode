# Time Complexity: for each of the methods, the time complexity is O( K/Nâ€‹) where N is the number of all possible keys and K is the number of predefined buckets in the hashmap, which is 2069 in our case.
# In the ideal case, the keys are evenly distributed in all buckets. As a result, on average, we could consider the size of the bucket is  
# K/N.

# Since in the worst case we need to iterate through a bucket to find the desire value, the time complexity of each method is O(K/N).

# Space Complexity: O(K+M) where K is the number of predefined buckets in the hashmap and M is the number of unique keys that have been inserted into the hashmap.
