What is a Monotonic Stack?
A monotonic stack is a stack data structure that keeps its elements in a specific sorted order (either always increasing or always decreasing).

Monotonically Increasing Stack: Elements are always in non-decreasing order from bottom to top. When you push a new element, you pop all elements from the top that are greater than it before pushing.

Monotonically Decreasing Stack: Elements are always in non-increasing order from bottom to top. When you push a new element, you pop all elements from the top that are smaller than it before pushing.
