# Time Complexity
# Time: O(4^n) Space: O(4^n)

# Why O(4^n)?
# String length grows exponentially - roughly doubles every few iterations
# We do n iterations - each processing the current string
# Each iteration is linear in the current string length
# Combined effect: exponential growth Ã— linear processing = exponential overall
# Simple explanation:
# Each step can make the string longer
# After many steps, strings get very long very fast
# Processing very long strings takes very long
# Result: exponential time complexity
# Bottom line: This algorithm gets extremely slow for large n (like n > 30) because the strings grow exponentially in length.

# The exact base (whether 2^n, 3^n, or 4^n) doesn't matter much - the key point is it's exponential, which means it becomes impractical for large inputs.
