1. Array and String Manipulation
Example: "Given an array of integers, find the two numbers that add up to a given target."

Example: "Write a function that reverses a string without using built-in functions."

These kinds of problems often focus on basic operations, like iterating through arrays, searching for patterns, or handling strings efficiently.

2. Sorting and Searching
Example: "Given a list of integers, find the kth largest element in the array."

Example: "Implement binary search to find a target value in a sorted array."

Sorting and searching problems are classic and often used in interviews, especially for assessing your understanding of algorithms.

3. Linked Lists
Example: "Reverse a linked list."

Example: "Detect a cycle in a linked list."

These problems test your knowledge of pointer manipulation, edge cases, and recursive or iterative solutions.

4. Tree and Graph Traversal
Example: "Write a function that performs an in-order traversal of a binary tree."

Example: "Given a graph, write a function to detect if there is a cycle."

Tree and graph problems are slightly more complex but can still be manageable within 15 minutes, especially if you have a solid understanding of recursion or iterative traversal methods.

5. Dynamic Programming (Intermediate Level)
Example: "Find the minimum number of coins needed to make up a target amount given a list of coin denominations."

Example: "Given a list of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence."

Dynamic programming problems can sometimes be solved in short time frames, particularly when you are given a small set of constraints.

6. Math/Number Theory
Example: "Write a function to determine whether a number is prime."

Example: "Given a list of integers, find the greatest common divisor of the numbers."

Google (Alphabet)
Reputation: Known for being the most algorithmically rigorous. They test your fundamental problem-solving skills and your ability to think from first principles.
Favorite Topics:
Graphs: This is arguably Google's favorite topic. Expect problems involving BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Union-Find, and Topological Sort. They love to see if you can model a problem as a graph.
Dynamic Programming (DP): They ask both simple and complex DP problems.
Trees and Recursion: Deep understanding of tree traversals and complex recursive logic is critical.
Scalability: Questions often have a follow-up like, "How would you solve this if you had billions of items?" This leads into system design territory.

Meta (Facebook)
Reputation: Fast-paced and practical. They want to see you write clean, bug-free code quickly. Problems often have a connection to social networks or their products.
Favorite Topics:
Graphs and Trees: A must-know, given the "social graph" nature of their products. Problems on finding connections, traversing hierarchies, etc., are common.
Arrays and Strings: A very high frequency of questions involving string manipulation, interval management, and array searching/sorting.
Hash Maps: Used in a vast number of problems to optimize solutions.
Greedy Algorithms: They seem to favor greedy approaches in their questions more than some other companies.

Amazon
Reputation: Very focused on practicality and their famous Leadership Principles (LPs). Your technical solution is just one part of the evaluation; how you exhibit the LPs is equally important.
Favorite Topics:
Trees: A huge topic at Amazon. You must know everything about binary trees, BSTs, and N-ary trees.
Data Structures: They ask a lot of questions about which data structure is the right tool for the job (e.g., "When would you use a Heap vs. a BST?").
Object-Oriented Design (OOD): Questions like "Design a parking lot" or "Design a movie ticketing system" are more common here, especially for mid-level and senior roles.
Graphs: Common for problems related to logistics and networks (e.g., finding the shortest path for a delivery).
Problems:

Q1. Closest K points to origin
Q2. Given two arrays A1, A2 and target, return the index from A1 and index from A2 whose sum is closest to target
- An array of integers representing vegetable types, repeatedly remove two different vegetables until no more pairs can be removed, and return the minimum number of vegetables left.
- Find the lexicographically smallest string by removing one digit and inserting its incremented value.

Apple
Reputation: The process is known to be more secretive and highly team-dependent. The questions are often very practical and related to the specific domain you're interviewing for (e.g., iOS, iCloud, Graphics).
Favorite Topics:
Core Data Structures and Algorithms: They have a strong focus on fundamentals. They value high-quality, robust, and optimized code.
Concurrency: If the role involves systems-level programming (e.g., for macOS or iOS frameworks), you might get questions on threads, mutexes, and race conditions.
API Design: Questions about how you would design a clean and intuitive API for a specific feature.
Practical Problems: Less abstract and more grounded in real-world application logic.

Netflix
Reputation: Netflix primarily hires senior engineers and their interview process reflects this. It's less about solving abstract puzzles and more about deep technical discussions.
Favorite Topics:
System Design: This is the main event. You'll be expected to have deep conversations about designing large-scale, distributed systems like the ones Netflix builds.
Concurrency and Networking: Critical for roles related to streaming and backend services.
Past Experience: Interviews are often deep dives into your past projects. They will challenge the architectural decisions you made.
A/B Testing and Data: Problems related to personalization, recommendation algorithms, and analyzing user data can come up.
