1. Array and String Manipulation
Example: "Given an array of integers, find the two numbers that add up to a given target."

Example: "Write a function that reverses a string without using built-in functions."

These kinds of problems often focus on basic operations, like iterating through arrays, searching for patterns, or handling strings efficiently.

2. Sorting and Searching
Example: "Given a list of integers, find the kth largest element in the array."

Example: "Implement binary search to find a target value in a sorted array."

Sorting and searching problems are classic and often used in interviews, especially for assessing your understanding of algorithms.

3. Linked Lists
Example: "Reverse a linked list."

Example: "Detect a cycle in a linked list."

These problems test your knowledge of pointer manipulation, edge cases, and recursive or iterative solutions.

4. Tree and Graph Traversal
Example: "Write a function that performs an in-order traversal of a binary tree."

Example: "Given a graph, write a function to detect if there is a cycle."

Tree and graph problems are slightly more complex but can still be manageable within 15 minutes, especially if you have a solid understanding of recursion or iterative traversal methods.

5. Dynamic Programming (Intermediate Level)
Example: "Find the minimum number of coins needed to make up a target amount given a list of coin denominations."

Example: "Given a list of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence."

Dynamic programming problems can sometimes be solved in short time frames, particularly when you are given a small set of constraints.

6. Math/Number Theory
Example: "Write a function to determine whether a number is prime."

Example: "Given a list of integers, find the greatest common divisor of the numbers."
